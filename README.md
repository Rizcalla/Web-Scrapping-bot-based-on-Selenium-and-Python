# Web Scrapping bot based on Selenium and Python

The bot is pretty simple: It'll try to obtain all the .CSV files generated by the Amazon Smart Scout View FREE Chrome Extension (https://smartscout.top/) so the data can be managed later for any purpose.

To run the bot you'll need:

- Python installed
    - You'll require selenium and pyautogui
- Java installed
- Chromedriver.exe

While running, the bot will ask for the location of Chromedriver.exe, User Data folder (provided) and an Amazon Department URL.

If your connection is good enough, you can change the time.sleep() times on the code so it'll run a little faster, just be aware that Amazon has control over access to their site, so you may need to use an alternating VPN.
